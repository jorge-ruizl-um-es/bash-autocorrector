## üîç Project Overview

This Python-based tool includes a set of scripts that provides various functionalities for processing Jupyter notebooks. It supports working with notebooks stored in locally cloned git repositories, checking if each file meets the deadline or the existence of any kind of plagiarism. In addition, it is focused on giving automated feedback over some notebooks providing a predefined set of solutions. This feedback is far more than a mere correction, as it is able to differentiate between certain states of each solution, evaluating the command and pointing out the kind of mistake in case it exists. 

**automates evaluation of Bash commands in Jupyter Notebooks** by:
- Comparing student submissions against reference solutions located in an specified directory.
- Providing **detailed, instant feedback** on each command.
- Highlighting **exact locations of errors** in incorrect commands, offering a collection of CSV files with the result of each evaluation.
