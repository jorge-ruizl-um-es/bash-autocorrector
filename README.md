## üîç Project Overview

This Python-based tool **automates evaluation of Bash commands in Jupyter Notebooks** by:
- Comparing student submissions against reference solutions located in an specified directory.
- Providing **detailed, instant feedback** on each command.
- Highlighting **exact locations of errors** in incorrect commands, offering a collection of CSV files with the result of each evaluation.

### Key Features
‚úÖ **Jupyter Notebook integration** - Works directly with `.ipynb` files  
‚úÖ **Precise error detection** - Identifies specific mistakes in Bash commands  
‚úÖ **Solution directory support** - Compares against reference implementations  
‚úÖ **Custom feedback generation** - Provides actionable improvement suggestions
